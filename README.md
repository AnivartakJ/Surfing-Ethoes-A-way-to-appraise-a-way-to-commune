About this project : 
<br>
<br>
This project aims to address the issue of mental health & the devastating consequences it can have on individuals. The lack of awareness and understanding of mental health has led to many people being unaware of their own critical mental health issues. The project proposes to develop a video call website that not only provides users with a seamless video chat experience but also monitors their mental health and provides solutions based on the results of conducted tests. The website will also offer features such as instantaneous polls and a user-friendly interface to make it stand apart from existing video call platforms.

To better understand the risks and consequences of mental health issues, the team will analyze datasets based on age, sex, and personality to identify the most vulnerable groups. The project will consist of five modules, including searching for appropriate raw data sets, analyzing data using Pandas, designing the website, adding video call utility, and creating a mental health monitoring system.

The website will aim to raise awareness of mental health issues and provide users with free mental health monitoring utility to measure their level of anxiety and depression. The instant feedback of the user's mental condition will help prevent future mental health threats by providing prior knowledge of their mental health. Mental illnesses affect a significant portion of the population each year, and the team hopes that their project will help address this issue.

The project will draw from various sources, including Forbes, the University of Nevada, McLean Hospital, and Patient.info, to better understand the effects of social media on mental health and video call fatigue. The team will use Agora.io, a pioneer in video call services, to develop the video call feature.

Overall, the project aims to create a video call website that not only provides users with a seamless video chat experience but also helps monitor their mental health and provides solutions based on the results of conducted tests. The team hopes that their project will raise awareness of mental health issues and help prevent future mental health threats by providing users with prior knowledge of their mental health.
